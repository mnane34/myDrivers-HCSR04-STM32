# Driver Development of HCSR-04 Ultrasonic Sensor on STM32 

# ‚ö° What is HCSR-04 Ultrasonic Sensors?

HCSR-04 Ultrasonic sensors use high-frequency sound waves to detect objects. They measure the time taken for the sound to travel to an object and reflect back. This allows accurate distance measurement in various applications.

# üî• How to Use HCSR-04 Ultrasonic Sensor with Microcontrollers?

Connect the TRIG and ECHO pins of the HC-SR04 to your microcontroller‚Äôs GPIO. Trigger the sensor with a short pulse and measure the duration of the echo signal. Use this time measurement to calculate the distance in centimeters or inches.

# üõ†Ô∏è Electrical Diagram

- **VCC (Pin 1)**  

Power supply pin, typically connected to +5V.

- **TRIG (Pin 2)**  

Trigger input pin. A short HIGH pulse (usually 10 ¬µs) is sent to start the measurement.

- **ECHO (Pin 3)**  

Echo output pin. It goes HIGH for a duration proportional to the distance of the object.

- **GND (Pin 4)**  

Ground connection (GND). It serves as the reference voltage for the circuit.
